We present **LingBot-World 2.0** (also known as **LingBot-World-Infinity**), an advanced iteration of [LingBot-World](https://technology.robbyant.com/lingbot-world) featuring four distinct upgrades.
- **Unbounded Interaction Horizon**: Our model achieves an unbounded interaction horizon while maintaining consistent output quality, benefiting from a carefully crafted causal pretraining paradigm.
- **Rapid Response Time**: Through distilling a real-time variant from the base model, our system guarantees rapid response time, sufficient to drive 720p video streams at 60 fps.
- **Highly Diverse Interactive Elements**: Compared to the previous version, this update introduces highly diverse interactive elements, comprising a broader spectrum of actions (*e.g.*, attacking, archery, spell-casting, and shooting) alongside a richer variety of text-driven events.
- **Agentic Harness**: We pioneer the integration of an agentic harness within the domain of world modeling, wherein a pilot agent is tasked with planning and executing character behaviors, while a director agent is responsible for synthesizing novel environmental elements as the scene progresses.


## 🚀 Try it now
The real-time version of LingBot-World-Infinity is available on two platforms. We thank [Reactor](https://www.reactor.inc/lingbot-world-v2) and [LingGuang](https://www.lingguang.com/support) for their support:
- **International (Web)**: Experience it on [Reactor](https://www.reactor.inc/lingbot-world-v2).
- **Domestic (Mobile)**: Experience it on [LingGuang](https://www.lingguang.com/support).

> **Note:** Reactor and LingGuang provide a convenient way to try LingBot-World-Infinity in real time. In our official setup, the model runs at full capability. To experience our official demo, join us at [WAIC 2026](https://waica2026.worldaic.com.cn/).

## 🔥 News
- Jul. 9, 2026: 🎉 We release the technical report, inference code, and models for LingBot-World-Infinity.

## 📋 TODO
- [x] Release the causal-fast inference code and model of the 14B model
- [ ] Release the causal-pretrained model of the 14B model
- [ ] Release the bidirectional model of the 14B model
- [ ] Release the causal-fast and causal-pretrained models of the 1.3B model

## ⚙️ Quick Start
This codebase is built upon [Wan2.2](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.2). Please refer to their documentation for installation instructions.
### Installation
Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/robbyant/lingbot-world-v2.git
cd lingbot-world-v2
```
Install dependencies:
```sh
# Ensure torch >= 2.4.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install [`flash_attn`](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention):
```sh
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```
### Model Download

| Model | Model Type | Model Size | Download Links |
| :---  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast** | causal-fast | 14B | 🤗 [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/robbyant/lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast) 🤖 [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/Robbyant/lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast) |
| **lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-pretrain** | causal-pretrain | 14B | TODO |

Download models using huggingface-cli:
```sh
pip install "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli download robbyant/lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast --local-dir ./lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast
```
Download models using modelscope-cli:
 ```sh
pip install modelscope
modelscope download robbyant/lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast --local_dir ./lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast
```

### Inference

We provide `generate.py` for causal inference with KV caching, which processes video frames chunk-by-chunk instead of all at once.
<!-- The `--infer_mode` flag selects the inference mode:

| infer_mode | Model | Sampling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `causal_fast` (default) | Distilled few-step model (`LingBot-World-Fast`) | 4 steps per chunk, no CFG |
| `causal_pretrain` | Pretrained causal model | 40 steps per chunk with CFG | -->

- `causal_fast` — 480P, multi-GPU:
  ``` sh
  torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 480*832 --ckpt_dir lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast --image examples/03/image.jpg --action_path examples/03 --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --frame_num 361 --local_attn_size 18 --sink_size 6 --prompt "A serene lakeside scene with a lone tree standing in calm water, surrounded by distant snow-capped mountains under a bright blue sky with drifting white clouds — gentle ripples reflect the tree and sky, creating a tranquil, meditative atmosphere."
  ```

<!-- - `causal_pretrain` — 480P, multi-GPU:
  ``` sh
  torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task i2v-A14B --infer_mode causal_pretrain --size 480*832 --ckpt_dir lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-pretrain --image examples/03/image.jpg --action_path examples/03 --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --frame_num 81 --prompt "A serene lakeside scene with a lone tree standing in calm water, surrounded by distant snow-capped mountains under a bright blue sky with drifting white clouds — gentle ripples reflect the tree and sky, creating a tranquil, meditative atmosphere."
  ``` -->

You can also use the provided `run_fast.sh` script:
``` sh
bash run_fast.sh <weights_dir> <frame_num>
# e.g. bash run_fast.sh lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast 361
```

### Deployment

This repository includes a persistent multi-GPU HTTP inference service in
`server.py` and a matching command-line client in `client.py`. See the
[HTTP inference service guide](docs/http-inference-service.zh-CN.md) for server
startup, parameter ownership, input formats, API endpoints, persistence, and
client examples.

For other deployment stacks, refer to the LingBot-World integrations in
[SGLang](https://docs.sglang.io/cookbook/diffusion/LingBot-World/LingBot-World-2.0)
or [flashdreams](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams).
